Performance artists Aino Unkila and Marko Alastalo make site-specific performances in abandoned or vacant buildings in different European cities. The performances explore disused urban places and the social and local history embedded in them. The artists make videos, photos, and installations based on the documentation material of those performances. Concepts arising from the process include fragility, transience, cycles and forgetting.
