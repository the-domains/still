Performance artists Aino Unkila and Marko Alastalo make site-specific 
performances in abandoned or vacant buildings in different European 
cities. The performances explore disused urban places and the social and
local history embedded in them. The artists make videos, photos, and 
installations based on the documentation material of those performances.
Concepts arising from the process include fragility, transience, cycles
and forgetting.
